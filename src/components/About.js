            <hr />
            <p> I love business and technology and it's been the backbone of my learning over the years. Sport is my most desired passion and I am an avid competitor. I love the interaction, challenges and ultimately the winning result. Endurance sport really resonates with me and it's prevalent in the way that I tackle work related projects, strategies and goals. I'm a resilient critical thinker with a curious mind and an unwavering passion for learning. I love solving problems and/or being the solution which has always motivated me to drive new ideas and opportunities. If there’s an opportunity to broaden my horizons, I’m sold.</p>
